        <article>
          <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
          <h1>Prequesites</h1>
          <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
          <h1>Guides</h1>
          <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.</p>
          <h4>Getting Started With html</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What's in the head? Metadata in HTML</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>HTML text fundamentals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Creating hyperlinks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advanced text formatting</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Document and website structure</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Debugging HTML</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Assessments</h1>
          <p>The following assessments will test your understanding of the HTML basics covered in the guides above.</p>
          <h4>Making up a letter</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test out text formatting skills. In this assessment, you'll be given a letter to mark up.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Structuring a page of content</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>This assessment tests your ability to use HTML to structure a simple page of content, containing a header, a footer, a navigation menu, main content, and a sidebar.</li>
          </ul>

        <header>Multimedia and Embedding</header>
        <article>
          <p>We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content! This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.</p>
          <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
          <p>Before starting this module, you should have a reasonable understanding of the basics of HTML, as previously covered in Introduction to HTML. If you have not worked through this module (or something similar), work through it first, then come back!</p>
          <h1>Guides</h1>
          <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the fundamentals of embedding multimedia on webpages.</p>
          <h4>Images in HTML</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble img element used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics, annotating it with captions using figure, and how it relates to CSS background images.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Video and audoi content</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML <video> and <audio> elements to embed video and audio on our pages, including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, adding captions and subtitles, and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>From object to iframe - other embedding technologies</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at a couple of elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the iframe, embed and object elements. iframes are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Adding vector graphics to the Web</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Vector graphics can be very useful in certain situations. Unlike regular formats like PNG/JPG, they don't distort/pixelate when zoomed in — they can remain smooth when scaled. This article introduces you to what vector graphics are and how to include the popular SVG format in web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Responsive images</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices. Responsive images are just one part of responsive design, a future CSS topic for you to learn.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Assessments</h1>
          <p>The following assessment will test your understanding of the material covered in the guides above.</p>
          <h4>Mozilla splash page</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In this assessment, we'll test your knowledge of some of the techniques discussed in this module's articles, getting you to add some images and video to a funky splash page all about Mozilla!</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>See Also<h1>
          <h4>Add a hitmap on top of an image</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Image maps provide a mechanism to make different parts of an image link to different places. (Think of a map linking through to further information about each different country you click on.) This technique can sometimes be useful.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Web literacy basics II</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>An excellent Mozilla foundation course that explores and tests some of the skills talked about in this Multimedia and embedding module. Dive deeper into the basics of composing webpages, designing for accessibility, sharing resources, using online media, and working open (meaning that your content is freely available and shareable by others).</li>

        <article>
          <p>A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.</p>
          <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
